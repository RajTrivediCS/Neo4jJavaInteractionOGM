# Neo4jJavaInteractionOGM

    This is an OGM Intro for loading data. An OGM (Object Graph Mapper) maps nodes and relationships in the graph to objects and references in a domain model (Java   
    Instance class). Object instances are mapped to nodes while object references are mapped using relationships, or serialized to properties. JVM primitives are mapped 
    to node or relationship properties.
  
    There are two advantages for OGM. Firstly, an OGM abstracts the database and provides a convenient way to persist your domain model in the graph and query it without 
    using low level drivers. Secondly, it provides the flexibility to the developer to supply custom queries where the queries generated by Neo4j-OGM are insufficient.
       
    One of the real-world applications for OGM is Java Business Applications. Developing Java Business Applications often requires mapping rich domain models to your 
    database.
   
    One of the ways we can implement OGM is through CRUD operations which are basic functions of persistent storage.
