# Neo4jJavaInteractionOGM
  Introduction:
    An OGM (Object Graph Mapper) maps nodes and relationships in the graph to objects and references in a domain model (Java Instance class). Object instances are mapped 
    to nodes while object references are mapped using relationships, or serialized to properties. JVM primitives are mapped to node or relationship properties.
  
  Advantages:
    1. An OGM abstracts the database and provides a convenient way to persist your domain model in the graph and query it without using low level drivers 
    2. It also provides the flexibility to the developer to supply custom queries where the queries generated by Neo4j-OGM are insufficient
       
  Applications:
    1. Developing Java Business Applications often requires mapping rich domain models to your database
   
  Implementation:
    OGM can be implemented through CRUD operations which are basic functions of persistent storage
